## Portfolio Choice with CARA-Normal Payoffs

**Useful fact:** Suppose an agent has CARA utility $u(X) = -\exp(-rX)$, where $r > 0$ is her coefficient of absolute risk aversion. Suppose her earnings are normally distributed, $X \sim N(\mu_X, \sigma^2_X)$. Then the agent's certainty equivalent is

$$
c(X) = \mu_X - \frac{r}{2} \sigma^2_X
$$

When faced with a set of lotteries, she chooses the one with the largest certainty equivalent $c(X)$.

We now consider a classic portfolio choice problem. An agent has initial wealth $W$. She chooses to invest $x \geq 0$ into a risky asset that pays $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ for each dollar invested, where $\mu > 1$. The remaining $W - x$ is invested into a riskless bond that pays $1 for each dollar invested. The agent's final wealth is $y = zx + (W - x)$ and her portfolio choice problem is

$$
\max_{x \geq 0} E[u(zx + (W - x))]
$$

(a) Given investment $x$, what is the mean and variance of the agent's final wealth? What is the agent's certainty equivalent?

The expected value is:

$$
E(y) = E(xz + (W - x))\\
E(y) = E(xz) + E(W - x)\\
E(y) = xE(z) + (W - x)\\
E(y) = x\mu + (W - x)\\
$$

>$$
> E(y) = x\mu + (W - x)\\
>$$

And the variance:

$$
V(y) = V(xz + (W - x))\\
V(y) = V(xz) V(W - x)\\
V(y) = x^2V(z)\\
V(y) = x^2\sigma^2
$$

>$$
>V(y) = x^2\sigma^2
>$$

The certain value of the investment is:

$$
c(y) = E(y) - \frac{r}{2}V(y)\\
$$

>$$
>c(y) = x \mu + (W -x) - \frac{r}{2}x^2\sigma^2\\
>$$

(b) What is the agent's optimal choice of investment, $x^*$, as a function of the model's parameters?

Knowing that she will choose the one with the largest certainty equivalent value, then:


$$
\max_{x} c(x) = x \mu + (W -x) - \frac{r}{2}x^2\sigma^2\\
$$

Calculating the F.O.C.:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}c(x) = 0 = \mu -1 - r\sigma^2 x
$$

>The optimal choice of investment is:
>
>$$
>x^* = \dfrac{\mu - 1}{r \sigma^2}
>$$

(c) How does $x^*$ vary with the mean return ($\mu$), the risk of the investment ($\sigma^2$), the agent's risk aversion ($r$), and her wealth ($W$)? What is the intuition?

If the expected return from the asset increases, the optimal investment will increase until it reaches $\mu = Wr\sigma^2 + 1$, which is the value where all the wealth is allocated into that asset. From this point, there is no possibility to increase the investment, even though the expected return increases.

As the risk or the risk aversion increases, she will reduce her investment until it gets close to zero.

As the wealth increases, the investment will not increase until the expected payment of the asset increases. In this case, she will increase her investment in bonds.
